<p>My name is Joshua Robles and I am a fresh graduate from both Lehman College and most recently from the NPower program. My time at Lehman College and my brief enrollment at NYC College of Technology have familiarized me with many aspects of programming. This is including but is not limited to C, Python, IOS Programming, SQL, Linux, Java, Networking, and Operating Systems programming. I am currently on my way to getting the CompTIA A++ certification by training within the NPower program. With my experience in retail, I am not shy about customer service and am a graduate of the NPower program fully equipped and ready to take on the tech world.</p>
